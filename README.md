# `parallel_python`
> breaking stereotypes about parallelism in python with examples


## üéØ Main goal 

The main point I wanted to convey with this repository is to show with simple toy examples that 
*"there is no multithreading in python"* and *"GIL breaks absolutely everything in python"* are stereoptypes. 

## ‚öîÔ∏è Way 

I'm trying to answer the following questions (yes, these questions are not about the same thing ...):
- *is parallelism possible in python?*
- *is true parallelism possible in python?*
- *is true parallelism possible in python for cpu bound tasks?*

and this repo contains **all the code needed** to answer them.

## ‚õèÔ∏è Hot to use it? 

To understand what will be discussed You can either watch the presentation [pdf](presentation.pdf) or read my [post](https://zinchse.github.io/blog/2023/parallel-python/).
You can also get by with just the code. I tried to make it *self-describing* and *self-contained*.
